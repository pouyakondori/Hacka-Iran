# Hacka Iran Platfrom Powered by Laravel PHP Framework

We've organized many many hackathons in Iran. Now we decided to create an open source platform for those people who are interested to organize a #hackathon or #hackacity in Iran. 
Hacka Iran project is developed and launch by private companies in Iran in order to empower the startup community in this country.

We decided to use Laravel as framework for Hacka Iran. Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
